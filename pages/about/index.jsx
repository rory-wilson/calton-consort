                  Calton Consort has established itself as one of Edinburgh's
                  most prominent chamber choirs, performing a varied and
                  challenging repertoire to high acclaim.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Performances are often a cappella and characterised by fresh
                  and dynamic interpretations of works from a wide range of
                  eras, with an emphasis on less frequently performed
                  compositions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calton Consort was founded in 2001 by 12 friends, who were
                  also singers, for a concert in aid of a church roof appeal.
                  The choir now comprises around 30 singers and typically
                  performs three concerts a year including appearances at the
                  Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
